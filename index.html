    <h1> My first program</h1>
    <p>Hi everybody, this is <strong>my first HTML project</strong> using <em>the Odin Project.</em></p>
    <!--hello this is the html comment-->
    <p>
        Here I've learnt many things such as
        <ul>
            <h3>
            <li>How to use <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener nonreferrer" target="_blank">git</a></h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener nonreferrer" target="_blank">

                </a>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>git status</h4>

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h4>HTML basic tags</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>head</h4>
                        <p>It is used to define the heading portion of the webpage.It contains the meta-information
                            of the webpage and meta tag is also declared in its scope along with the charset. It also
                            contains the title tag, which we would discuss below.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>body</h4>
                        <p>It is used to hold the characteristics and display the contents that are visible in the webpage
                            to the user.It may contain text,images,links and so on.This tag is also used to define the properties
                            of the font and other contents.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>meta</h4>
                        <p>This tag basically contains the information linked with the browser and how the webpage will work on
                            the browser.What it will use such as charset, the charset defined should align with the web browser
                            so that all the special characters and emojis and other thing should be well displayed to the user 
                            such that the content and charset is well supported by the web browser.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>title</h4>
                        <p>This tag is used to display what is the webpage about and gives and introductory idea to the user 
                            about the webpage.By default if the developer doesn't mention the title tag then the file name of 
                            HTML document will be displayed as the title. The title is placed in the title bar
                            (<em>Often referred to as the tab specifically on google chrome and other browsers</em>).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>i/em</h4>
                        <p> These tags are used to italicize the text. The 'i' stands for the abbreviation for italics, on the
                            other hand the 'em' tag is used to showcase that the text is emphasised by italicising it. They both
                            do the same work, the difference between them is their use as per <strong><i>semantics</i></strong>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>b/strong</h4>
                        <p>These tags are used to bold the text. The 'b' stands for the abbreviation for bold, on the
                            other hand the 'strong' tag is used to showcase that the text needs strong attention by making it bold. 
                            They both do the same work, the difference between them is their use as per <strong><i>semantics</i>
                            </strong>.
